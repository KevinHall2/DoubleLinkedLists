# DoubleLinkedLists

This program contains a double linked list that can be used for object pooling. The header files "Iterator.h", "List.h", and "Node.h" 
contain the code that is required to use this double linked list in different projects of your choice. The header files can be extracted 
from the .zip file downloaded from the release page [here](https://github.com/KevinHall2/DoubleLinkedLists/releases).
